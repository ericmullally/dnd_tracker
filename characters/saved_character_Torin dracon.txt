The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a wish spell or Divine Intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.\n\n12:Jester: You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws. \n\n13:Skull: You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly Humanoid Skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the DM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 Hit Points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own Avatar of Death. A creature slain by an Avatar of Death can't be restored to life."]]}, "ability_score_increase": "Strength by 2, Charisma by 1", "background_skills": ["deception", "sleight of hand"]}
